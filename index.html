    <h1>my best friends in the whole world!</h1>
    <p>this is my girlfriend Emma and our furry babies Lego, Arlo and Obi <br> Obi is a collie and is nearly a year old, Arlo is a little ginger cat and is 3 months old, 
      lastly lego is 3 and it is a medical mystery what breed of cat she is, I tend to describe her as a little bin cat (with love)</p>
